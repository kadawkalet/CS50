#### Description:
###### Prerequisites

The web application is built by using flask framework in Python programing language with style sheet CSS powered by Bootstrap. The prerequisites are as follows:
1. Installing python3, [Mac OS Python3 installation](https://docs.python-guide.org/starting/install3/osx/)
3. Setting up Flask environment, [Flask tutorial in Vscode](https://code.visualstudio.com/docs/python/tutorial-flask)
2. Import CSS, Javascript and front-end bootstraps features, [Boostrap Installation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/3.4/getting-started/)

###### Calculators

There are two parts of calculator in this web application. The first one is as it can be seen the top menus, the accounting calculator, which consists of:
- Activity ratios: asset turnover, average collection period, cash conversion cycle, inventory conversion period etc.
- Basic Equations: asset, EBIT, equity, gross profit, liability, net profit, operating profit and sales.
- Debt Ratios: Debt to equity ratio, debt ratio, debt service coverage ratio and long-term debt to equity ratio.
- Depreciation: Book value, declining balance, straight-line method, units of production.
- Liquidity Ratios: quick ratio, cash ratio, current ratio and OCF ratio.
- Market Ratios: dividen cover, dividend yield, DPS, EPS, Payout ratio, PEG ratio and Price to Sales Ratio.
- Profitability Ratios: Efficiency ratio, gross profit ratio, return on sales, net profit ratio, return on assets, return on capital, return on equity, return on investment, return on net assets and risk-adjusted ROC.
- Amortisation: this model is often used to determine a life cycle of a loan based on the the repayment, life of a loan based on the interest charged.

The second part is financial models, which consists of:
- Net Present Value Model: this model takes cash flows and convert them into preset values in order to determine the NPV. The model can be applied to a project valuation or company valuation etc.
- Discounted Cash Flow Model: similar to NPV model, DCF model is often used to evaluate company valuation or perhap some projects with perpitual cash flow. The main difference is the terminal value which is determined by using the final cash flow and discounted according to a constant growth rate.

These Calculators will take inputs from the users and product output based on their predefined formulas.
